# Hangman (Pseudocode)

```
Generate a word
Ask player for a letter
Player chooses a letter
Check if the letter is found in the word
If the letter is in the word, display the letter
If the letter is not in the word, display a (new) part of the body and the letter in a separate list
If player chooses all the letters in the word, they win
If the whole body is displayed before player 2 chooses all the letter, they lose
Game ends
